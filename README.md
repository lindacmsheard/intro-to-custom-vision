# Introduction to Computer Vision

## Pre-requisites
- Access to an Azure subcription, with contributor rights to at least one resource group.

## Review the sample data in this repo
- [./sampledata/Ozgenel2019](./sampledata/Ozgenel2019) is from *2018 – Özgenel, Ç.F., Gönenç Sorguç, A. “Performance Comparison of Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks on Crack Detection in Buildings”, ISARC 2018, Berlin.* The full dataset can be downloaded to local machine with the script [./data/fetch_Ozgenel2018_data_to_local.sh](./data/fetch_Ozgenel2018_data_to_local.sh).

- [./sampledata/RDD2020](./sampledata/RDD2020) contains a subset of road images from the Czech Republic, from *Arya D, Maeda H, Ghosh SK, Toshniwal D, Sekimoto Y. RDD2020: An annotated image dataset for automatic road damage detection using deep learning. Data Brief. 2021 May 12;36:107133. doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2021.107133. PMID: 34095382; PMCID: PMC8166755.*

## [optional] Provision a Cognitive Services Resource in Azure 

Use of the Custom Vision Portal and API requires a cognitive services resource.

> 💡 You can skip this section if you want to provision this from within the custom vision interface in the next step. 

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based services that encapsulate artificial intelligence capabilities you can incorporate into your applications. You can provision individual cognitive services resources for specific APIs (for example, Language or Computer Vision), or you can provision a general Cognitive Services resource that provides access to multiple cognitive services APIs through a single endpoint and key. In this case, you'll use a single Cognitive Services resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Select the ＋Create a resource button, search for cognitive services, and create a Cognitive Services resource with the following settings:
   - Subscription: Your Azure subscription
   - Resource group: Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)
   - Region: Choose any available region
   - Name: Enter a unique name
   - Pricing tier: Standard S0
3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. Go to the resource and view its Keys and Endpoint page. This page contains the information that you will need to connect to your resource and use it from applications you develop. Specifically:
   - An HTTP endpoint to which client applications can send requests.
   - Two keys that can be used for authentication (client applications can use either key to authenticate).
   - The location where the resource is hosted. This is required for requests to some (but not all) APIs.

## Create a Classification Model
Use the provided Ozgenel2018 dataset to create a concrete crack classification model.

> 💡 You can use your own dataset, but we suggest using a datset that has been chipped up in a similar way to the provided sample.

Follow the instructions to do so via the Custom Vision studio interface here:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier 

Use the `Quick Training` Method.

Refer to this page to choose a domain model to use for transfer learning:

- [Selecting a Domain Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/select-domain)


### Discuss
1. What is the experience of creating a training data set?
2. What issues can you foresee with the provided sample dataset
3. How would you interpret the model performance metrics
3. How might you improve the training data strategy

## Create an Object Detection Model
Use the provided RD2020 dataset sample to create a Road Damage object detection model.

You can also use your own dataset instead. 

Follow the instructions to do so via the Custom Vision studio interface here:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector


### Discuss
1. What is the experience of creating a training data set?
2. What issues can you foresee with the provided sample dataset?
3. How would you interpret the model performance metrics?
4. Which of your two models would you have more confidence in at this point in time?
